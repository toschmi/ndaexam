# Nonlinear Data Analysis Concepts
### Project for Examination Work - Recurrence Analysis of Climate Variation in the Northern Hemisphere

1. A frequently used climate proxy for the northern-hemisphere climate is NGRIP data ([doi:10.1038/nature02805](http://doi.org/10.1038/nature02805)]). Download the data and preprocess the data if necessary.

2. Estimate embedding parameters and reconstruct and present the phase space trajectory.

3. Construct a RP of this embedded time series. Check different options of recurrence criteria and discuss your final choice. Interpret the visual appearance of the RP.

4. Compute the $\tau$-recurrence rate as a function of $\tau$ and display the results. Check different filtering options (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass filter) and their impact on the $\tau$-recurrence rate.

5. Make a fourier transform of all the $\tau$-recurrence rate and show the squared absolute values of these transforms as a function of the sampling period (recurrence based powerspectrum).

6. Make a Fourier Analysis of the original time series and compare and discuss the powerspectrum with the recurrence based powerspectrum.
