### Project for Examination Work - Recurrence Analysis of Total Solar Variation in the Holocene

1. Solar irradiance for the last 9300 years was reconstructed in the seminal work by Steinhilber et al, 2009 ([doi:10.1029/2009GL040142](http://doi.org/10.1029/2009GL040142)). Download the data and preprocess the data if necessary.

2. Estimate embedding parameters and reconstruct and present the phase space trajectory.

3. Construct a RP of this embedded time series. Check different options of recurrence criteria and discuss your final choice. Interpret the visual appearance of the RP.

4. Apply windowing analysis. Select and justify the size of the moving window. Compute a standard linear statistic in the running window over the original time series (e.g. mean or standard-deviation). Plot the results of the running window analysis together with the time series you generated.

5. Calculate the recurrence quantification analysis measures DET and ENTR in the moving windows. Compare the results with the other running statistics.

*Note that due to the windowed analysis you will not only loose as many data points as the chosen window size, but you also have to correct for the embedding, if you embed the data.*
